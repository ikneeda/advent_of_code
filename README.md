# Advent of Code 

Advent of Code is a yearly programming challenge developed by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).

From the [site](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about):
>  Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

I started this challenge as a way to improve upon my problem solving skills (and to have fun)! Solutions will be primarily written in JavaScript and Ruby.
